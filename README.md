# About this repository
The projects in this repo satisfy requirements for my Data analytics nano-degree. There are 3 projects in this repository.

## Project 1- Medical appointment analytics
This project focuses on exploring data and generating general insights from Medical appointments database. This project has

* Research questions
* Data wrangling
* Exploratory analytics
* Conclusion

### Project 1 files:
* _data_investigation.ipynb_  **contains code, graphs, tables and report**
* _data_investigation(2).html ****contains code, graphs, tables and report in html format**

### Project 2 - Data wrangling
This project focuses on data wrangling and reporting. Data wrangling for this project was achieved in 4 critical steps:

#### 1. Data gathering
Data was gathered from twitter using _tweepy_ a python wrapper for twittter api. Udacity provided tweets ids and they were used to extract tweets from the api. All this was done in the python script _fetch_tweets_data.py_. I removed my api credentials from this file, replace with your credentials to run this script. The data was stored in json format in the tweets_json.txt and csv in tweets_data.csv.

#### 2. Data Assessment
This step was implemented in the _wrangle_act.ipynb_ file adopting both visual and programmatic Assessment. This step checks on data quality and tidy

#### 3. Data Cleaning
This was done in _wrangle_act.ipynb_ file.

#### 4. Report
All tasks and findings were documented here. _act_report.pdf_ documents project finding while _wrangle_report.pdf_ documents data gathering , Assessment and Cleaning efforts.

**Final clean data was merged and stored in** _twitter_archive_master.csv_

## Project 3 - coming soon
